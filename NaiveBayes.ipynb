The idea is that, if you have a set of data that is skewed in some way, you can adjust the data to make it more representative of the population as a whole. For example, if you have a set of data that is skewed towards positive values, you can add a small amount to each value to make the data more evenly distributed."

It is important to understand when working with Naive Bayes because the algorithm relies on the assumption that all features are independent of each other. This means that the probability of a particular feature occurring is not affected by the presence or absence of other features. Therefore, by understanding conditional probability, we can more accurately calculate the probability of a particular event occurring, given the presence or absence of other features."
