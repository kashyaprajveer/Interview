A flexible model is having high variance because the learned parameters like the structure of the decision tree, etc will vary with the training data. On the contrary, an inflexible model is said to have a high bias as it makes assumptions about the training data and an inflexible model may not have the capacity to fit even the training data and in both situations, the model has high variance, and high bias implies the model is not able to generalize new and unseen data points properly.\n",
