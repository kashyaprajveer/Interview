    "1) What is Logistic Regression in Machine Learning ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance of belonging to a given class or not. It is a kind of statistical algorithm, which analyze the relationship between a set of independent variables and the dependent binary variables. It is a powerful tool for decision-making. For example email spam or not. "

If we square this nonlinear transformation, then it will lead to the problem of non-convexity with local minimums and by using gradient descent in such cases, it is not possible to find the global minimum. As a result, MSE is not suitable for Logistic Regression.\n",
